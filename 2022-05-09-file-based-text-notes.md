## Options

### Desktop:

  - Foam VS Code Extention - Syncs to Git
    - updates links if filename changes
    - generates links compatibile with github, but does it with some kind of footer
 
| probel: I have not figured out how to easily sync with gitub both ways

### Multiplatform:

  - Obsidian - paid sync or iCloud

### Mobile:

 - GitJournal (purchased on iOS) has some wierd style wiki-style links. No auto-save.
 - iOS (and Mac) 1Writer

## Detailed notes

### Foam
Tips from [this article](https://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2021/03/01/notes-app/) :
- GistPad to not avoid the local copy of the Git repo
- GitDoc to **auto commit and auto push changes** using some VSCode friendly web based editor like GitHub Codespaces or CodeReady Workspaces for the web usage
- GitJournal for the mobile support

### Notable
Mac app stores notes as local .md files in a single folder. No subfolders.  Supports tags. Filename is genrate from first line of the note, if first line is changed - filename is changed automtically.
Design similar to Simplenote, but there are not snippets of notes. Wiki-syple links are supported [[]]. But Links are only clickable in the split view (markdown preview)

### 1Writer
- wiki-style links
- renames links if file is renamed
- filenames are genrated base on date and time or set manually
