## Detailed notes

### Foam
Tips from [this article](https://emmanuelbernard.com/blog/2021/03/01/notes-app/) :
- GistPad to not avoid the local copy of the Git repo
- GitDoc to **auto commit and auto push changes** using some VSCode friendly web based editor like GitHub Codespaces or CodeReady Workspaces for the web usage
- GitJournal for the mobile support
