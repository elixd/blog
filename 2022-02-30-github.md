    gh auth login

## Puplish local code to github

    git init -b main

Bublish / Create remote repo from local

    gh repo create

You will also need to chose branch name, for example "origin"


-----------
Usage
-----------

### Commit files to project:

    git add . && git commit -m "initial commit"

### Push files to GiHub:

    git push  <REMOTENAME> <BRANCHNAME>

For example:

    git push  origin main

To use just `git push` you need to initiall set upstream branch:

    git push --set-upstream origin main

### Pull changes from GitHub

    git pull origin main

If upstream barch has been set, the `git pull` may be used
