# ERPnext notes

## MWS
it is possible make a tree structure of warehouses which may be repurposed as "address storage" with bins,
but as on april 2022 there is no functionality to work with storage location barcodes.

There is not mobile or desktop solution to replicate workflow when receiving or issuing items to/from location:
   1. scan item barcode
   2. scan storage loaction (bin) barcode
This is normal routine which is followed in modern warehouse to keep stock balance for each storage location.

ERPNext however has barcode scanning functionality for items. This can be use with smartphone camera. 
This solution is inferior to professional mobile barcode scanners like Honeywell with Android OS, which are much
faster at scanning and have physical buttoons for the purpose.

## Items
Each item has item code and item name. Item code is supposed to be short version item name. Otions are:
 - item code is gnrat automatically
 - manualy entry of item code
 - item code = item name
